This log file should be named 'development_log.txt' and located in the project root. If the file does not exist, it must be created. Each log entry should include the timestamp of the modification, the path of the modified file, the type of modification (e.g., bug fix, optimization, style correction), and a clear description of the change. The date for the log entries for a given day should be based on the first interaction timestamp of that day.",
